# Docker
## What is Docker?
- Docker is a platform that allows you to develop, deploy, and run applications in containers.

## Why should we use Docker?
- Simplifies the process of packaging applications and their dependencies.
- Provides consistency across different environments.
- Increases efficiency by enabling faster deployment and scaling.

## When should we use Docker?
- When you want to ensure consistent environments for development, testing, and production.
- To streamline deployment processes and make applications more portable.
- For isolating applications and their dependencies without the need for separate virtual machines.

## How can we use Docker?
- Define applications and their dependencies in Dockerfiles.
- Build Docker images from Dockerfiles.
- Run containers based on these images to execute applications.

## Virtualisation VS Containerisation
- Virtualization creates virtual machines with separate operating systems, while containerization uses shared OS kernels for lightweight isolation.

## Container Life Cycle

## Docker Volumes
- Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by containers or share data between containers and the host.

## Docker logs
- Docker provides logs that capture the output and behavior of containers, helpful for troubleshooting and monitoring.

## Development Environment with Docker
- Docker simplifies setting up development environments by encapsulating dependencies and configurations within containers.

## Docker Hub
### What is Docker Hub?
- Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry where you can store and share Docker images.

### Why should we use Docker Hub?
- Access to a vast library of pre-built images for various applications and services.
- Simplifies the sharing and distribution of Docker images among teams.

### When should we use Docker Hub?
- When you need to quickly access existing Docker images for common software components.
- To collaborate with others by sharing and pulling Docker images easily.

### How can we use Docker Hub?
- Search for images on Docker Hub.
- Pull images to your local machine using `docker pull`.
- Push your own images to Docker Hub with `docker push`.

## Docker Installation Guide
1. Download the latest Docker installer [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). Ensure that you select the correct version for your machine.
2. Run the installer.
3. Restart your PC when prompted.
4. You should be greeted with this screen once you have restarted your PC.<br>

5. Press Finish.
6. Congratualations. You have now installed Docker.

## Docker Commands
`docker run -d`: Creates and starts a new container from a Docker image. The -d means detached mode, this will run your container in the background.

`docker images`: Lists all downloaded Docker images on your system.

`docker stop`: Halts a running container.

`docker start`: Resumes a stopped container.

`docker ps`: Shows running containers.

`docker ps -a`: Displays all containers, including stopped ones.

`alias docker="winpty docker"`: Sets up a shortcut for running Docker commands on Windows systems.

`docker exec -it container_id bin/bash`

`docker rm`

`docker rmi`

### Configuring a new docker image to have the basics that I am used to having:
```
apt-get update -y
apt-get upgrade -y
apt-get install sudo -y
apt-get install nano -y
```




### Commiting a running docker container to an image on a DockerHub repository.
```
docker ps
docker commit container_id dockerhub_username/docker_repo:latest
docker images
docker tag image_id dockerhub_username/docker_repo:latest
docker push dockerhub_username/docker_repo:latest
```


## Containerising the Sparta Test App using Docker

1. Create a Dockerfile in the same folder as your app code.
   My directory looked like this:

   ![alt text](image-3.png)

2. You will need to have an nginx.conf file, and a supervisord.conf file.
   
   ```
   server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
   }
   ```

   ```
   [supervisord]
   nodaemon=true

   [program:nginx]
   command=nginx -g "daemon off;"

   [program:node]
   command=node app.js
   ```

3. Use the following code within the Dockerfile
   ```
   FROM node:latest
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx supervisor

   COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
   WORKDIR /usr/src/app

   COPY ./app /usr/src/app

   RUN npm install

   EXPOSE 80
   EXPOSE 3000

   COPY supervisord.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf

   CMD ["/usr/bin/supervisord"]
   ```

4. Use the following commands to run the Sparta App:
   
   `docker build -t martin-sparta-app .`

   `docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 3000:3000 martin-sparta-app`

5. Push to dockerhub
   
   Use the process outlined [here](https://github.com/Martin-Muraskovas/microservices_learning/blob/main/docker/readme.md#commiting-a-running-docker-container-to-an-image-on-a-dockerhub-repository)


### Implementing a reverse proxy

Modify your docker file to contain this line: 

```
FROM node:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx supervisor

COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY ./app /usr/src/app

RUN npm install

EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 3000

COPY supervisord.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf

CMD ["/usr/bin/supervisord"]
```
