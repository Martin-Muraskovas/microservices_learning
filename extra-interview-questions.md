# Interview Questions

## What is containerization?
Containerization is a technology that allows you to package and run applications and their dependencies in isolated environments called containers.


## Difference between monolith, 2-tier, and microservices architecture:
Monolith: Single large application with all components tightly coupled.
2-Tier: Client-server architecture with separate presentation and database layers.
Microservices: Architecture where applications are broken down into small, independent services that communicate with each other.


## What is Docker?
Docker is a platform that enables you to develop, deploy, and run applications in containers.


## Why has Docker become so popular?
Docker's popularity is due to its ability to simplify application deployment, increase efficiency, and provide consistency across different environments.


## What is a container?
A container is a standardized unit of software that packages an application and its dependencies for easy deployment.


## What is a Docker image?
A Docker image is a read-only template that contains everything needed to run a container, including the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.


## What is a Dockerfile?
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the environment, dependencies, and commands needed to create the image.


## What does a Dockerfile allow you to do?
A Dockerfile allows you to automate the creation of Docker images by defining the steps needed to build the image in a reproducible way.


## What can you tell me about 'Docker Compose'?
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to manage multiple containers as a single service.


## What is DockerHub?
DockerHub is a cloud-based registry where you can store, find, and share Docker images. It provides a platform for managing container images.


## Can a paused container be removed in Docker?
Yes, a paused container can be removed in Docker using the docker rm command.


## Difference between virtualization and containerization:
Virtualization creates virtual machines with separate operating systems, while containerization shares the host OS kernel for lightweight isolation.


## What are Docker Volumes?
Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by containers, share data between containers, or store data independently of the container's life cycle.


## Essential Docker commands:
docker run, docker build, docker ps, docker images, docker exec, docker stop, docker rm, docker pull.


## How would you create a container from an image?
To create a container from an image, you use the docker run command followed by the image name.


## What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.


## What is a node in Kubernetes?
A node in Kubernetes is a physical or virtual machine that runs containers and is part of a Kubernetes cluster.


## What is a pod in Kubernetes?
A pod in Kubernetes is the smallest deployable unit that can run one or more containers sharing networking and storage resources.


## In Kubernetes, what is deployment?
In Kubernetes, a deployment is a resource object used to define and manage the lifecycle of pods and replica sets.


## What is a cluster of containers in Kubernetes?
A cluster in Kubernetes is a group of nodes that collectively run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes.


## What are the different services available in Kubernetes?
ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, Ingress, etc.


## What is ClusterIP?
ClusterIP is a Kubernetes service that exposes a set of pods internally within the cluster.


## What is NodePort?
NodePort is a Kubernetes service that exposes a set of pods on a specific port on each node in the cluster.


## What is a Load Balancer in Kubernetes?
A Load Balancer in Kubernetes is a service that automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple pods to ensure high availability and scalability.


## What is a config-map in Kubernetes?
A config-map in Kubernetes is an object used to store non-sensitive configuration data that can be consumed by pods or other resources.


## What is Kubectl? Have you used it?
Kubectl is a command-line tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters. It is used to deploy applications, inspect cluster resources, and manage Kubernetes objects.


## Would you feel comfortable showcasing Kubernetes to those who have not used it before?
Yes, I would feel comfortable showcasing Kubernetes to beginners by explaining its key concepts, demonstrating basic commands, and illustrating common use cases.

## What does "ingress" mean in Kubernetes? What about "egress"?
In Kubernetes, "ingress" refers to the process of allowing external traffic into the cluster to access services. "Egress" refers to the process of allowing traffic from inside the cluster to go out to external destinations.
