# Example Interview Questions

## What is the role of DevOps?
The role of a DevOps engineer is to foster collaboration between different teams that are involved in software development, primarily these teams will be the development and operations team however other teams could be involved such as sales teams. Another responsibility of a DevOps engineer is to automate processes within the Software Development Life Cycle, an example of this is using a CICD pipeline which saves a lot of time for testing and deploying code changes in an automated manner.


## What is the difference between orchestration and configuration management?
Orchestration is the process of provisioning or creating infrastructure using an Infrastructure as Code tool such as Terraform, while Configuration Management is the process of remotely configuring these existing infrastructures using an Infrastructure as Code tool such as Ansible. I like to look at it as Orchestration is outside of the machines while Configuration management is within the machines.


## How does Terraform manage state?
Terraform manages state by looking at the current state of your infrastructure and the desired state that you have provided it with. These states are then stored in state files so that Terraform can recognise and apply the appropriate changes so that the current state matches the desired state. Terraform will create these files during the use of the plan and apply commands, and these files are locked so that the data remains stable in a multi user environment.


## What is the difference between Virtualisation and Containerisation?
Virtualisation creates virtual machines with separate operating systems and hardware, while containerisation uses shared OS kernels for lightweight isolation as well as sharing hardware resources with the machine it is operating on.


## Why did you choose Sparta Global?
I chose Sparta Global as while researching Sparta, I noticed their strong emphasis on training. As a recent graduate I wanted to ease my way into my tech career and have a place to learn and be able to ask questions about how the industry works. That made me feel that the Sparta approach would be best way forward for me personally.
